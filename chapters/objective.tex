\chapter*{\centering Objective}

The aim of this project was to provide an analysis to Distributed Ledger Technologies, with the objective of identifying their risks, opportunities and implementation viability on different scales. The research work starts from a brief introduction to the technology and how the industry has been adapting to it, with statistical and analytical evidence. The paper then develops on the comparative analysis between the main competing technologies.

In accordance to the research findings, the project also aimed to provide a proof-of-concept architectural design of a solution for a credits interchange system using the most suited DLT implementation between the analyzed ones.

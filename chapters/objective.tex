\chapter*{\centering Objective}

The aim of this project was to provide an analysis to Distributed Ledger Technologies, with the objective of identifying their risks, opportunities and implementation viability on a small to broad scale. 
In accordance to such findings, the project also aimed to provide a proof-of-concept architectural design of a solution for a credits interchange system using the most suited DLT arrangement between the current settled implementations.

Definizione e studio di una soluzione basata su tecnologie DLT per un sistema di gestione di voucher per beni o servizi - Stesura della documentazione di design ad alto livello della soluzione - Eventuale analisi di dettaglio di un componente del sistema, e sua eventuale implementazione prototipale 

This report aims to provide an analytical framework for central banks and other authorities to
review and analyse DLT arrangements – in the conceptual, experimental or implementation phases – with
the objective of understanding the use cases, and identifying opportunities and risks. Market participants
may also find the report useful. The framework focuses on the potential implications for efficiency and
safety, and for financial markets more broadly. The framework is directed primarily at arrangements that
involve restricted ledgers (access to which is for approved users only), reflecting the main types of
arrangement currently being developed in the financial sector, which are of particular interest to the
relevant authorities.
